This document describes the requirements for ....  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicity state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
- Developer

\subsubsection{The Client}
- Developer

\subsubsection{The Customers}
- Developer
- Web Game Users

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
- Advertizers

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

User characteristics should go under assumptions.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Run on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari browsers.
    \item The game shall contain pre-game, playing, post-game, and paused states.
    \item When initially ran, the pre-game screen shall show first.
    \item On the pre-game screen, if the play button is pressed, the playing screen shall show.
    \item On the press of the pause button during playing, the pause screen shall show.
    \item On the press of the pause button while paused, the playing screen shall show again.
    \item The playing screen shall always display the player character, score and lives.
    \item Every time the player character is hit by an enemy, the lives shall decrease by one.
    \item When the fire button is pressed, the player character will fire a projectile.
    \item If a projectile hits an enemy, the enemy will be removed, that enemy's death action will occur and the score will be incremented.
    \item If zero lives remain and the player character is hit, the game shall enter the post game screen.
    
  \end{itemize}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}

\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
- Existing implementations of Asteroids
  - Many languages, just in case JavaScript cannot be run
  - Varying input methods, features and looks

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsection{Tasks}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

\subsection{Risks}

\subsection{Costs}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

\subsection{Waiting Room}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
