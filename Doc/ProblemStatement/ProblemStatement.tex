\maketitle

Vision: Planning, designing and implementing a large piece of software is an expensive and
daunting task. However, for games there is less of a focus on the documentation because the
software is not meant to be altered by the user, but that doesn't mean that other programmers
will not try to edit and revise the game to make it better or their own versions.
This is true in Doug McInnes' HTML5-Asteroids program, a version of the arcade game Asteroids
was developed for a user to enjoy. However, when looking at the code, it is a convoluted mess of
functions and statements making it very difficult for a programmer to understand and work on
if they desired to make edits. If the game were designed more in accordance to software desgin
principles, the game would be better to both the user and other developers.
\\Issue Statement: While functional, HTML5-Asteroids lacks the process structure and
documentation of a large software project. This makes edits, revisons, and additions to the
code more difficult as well as making the code less readable for other programmers. The game
also does not follow the software engineering principles of modularity or information hiding.
\\Method: By using the proper software design principles and process, the Asteroids game can
be recreated with the future in mind. It will allow for the game to be expanded upon and more
easily comprehended by any programmer that wishes to work on it or understand how the game was
developed.
